  So far we have converted data set into a data frame to visualise the data set. Now we are working on the next step of cleaning, preprocessing and feature engineeirng.

### At 5pm
  - We implmeted some merging functionality which basically merges all the seperate five years of data into one csv file.
  - This enabales us to efficiently preprocessed the data for future uses.
  - Now next step is to pre-proccess the merged data and remove duplicacy and nullability.
